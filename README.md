# CSCI_725_Project
## Four Datasets
### /baseline
- These datasets contain data that has clean, balanced activity to get our first throughput and latency numbers
- Balanced Data for Sanity Checks. Each scenario already includes its own customers and merchants.
- Additional Info:
    ```
    scenario: baseline
    customers: 40000 rows
    merchants: 2000 rows
    accounts: 10000 rows
    transactions: 100000 rows
    seed: 7252025
    ```
### /edgecases
- These datasets contain data that help with correctness checks. They include frozen and closed accounts as well as a few duplicate transfer ids to test if our unique rules can catch them.
- Edgecase-Handling Data. Includes attempted overdrafts to verify your guards. Expect some operations to be rejected by your unique transfer id constraint or index.
- Additional Info:
    ```
    scenario: edgecases
    customers: 40000 rows
    merchants: 2000 rows
    accounts: 5000 rows
    transactions: 50000 rows
    contents: frozen and closed accounts and a few duplicate transfer ids to test idempotency
    seed: 7252025
    ```
### /hotspot
- These datasets contain data that are heavily skewed where most writes hit a small set of accounts to test contention
- Skewed Access Pattern. The read or write mix is the same as baseline, but the hot keys create contention.
- Additional Info:
    ```
    scenario: hotspot
    customers: 40000 rows
    merchants: 2000 rows
    accounts: 10000 rows
    transactions: 100000 rows
    skew: 80 percent of writes hit 20 percent of accounts
    seed: 7252025
    ```
### /payday
- These datasets contain data that gives strong time spikes to test burst behavior and recovery
- Spike Heavy Time Series. During spikes there are more deposits and transfers, which stresses write paths and recent history queries.
- Additional Info:
    ```
    scenario: payday
    customers: 40000 rows
    merchants: 2000 rows
    accounts: 10000 rows
    transactions: 100000 rows
    time spikes: two day spikes with five times arrival rate
    seed: 7252025
    ```

## Application Functions
- **Open Account**: create a new account for a customer with status open and balance 0.
- **Deposit**: add money to an account. Append a transaction row and update the account balance inside one unit of work.
- **Withdraw**: take money out if funds plus overdraft allow it. Append a transaction row and update the balance in one unit of work.
- **Transfer**: move money between two accounts or to a verified merchant. Before completing the transfer, the system validates that the senderâ€™s account has sufficient funds, the receiver or merchant exists, and that the merchant (if involved) is active. If valid, it creates two transaction rows (a debit and a credit) with the same transfer_id, commits them together as one atomic operation, and rejects duplicates by transfer_id.
- **Get Balance**: read the current account balance.
- **View Recent Transactions**: read the last N transactions for an account, ordered by timestamp descending.
- **Close/Freeze Account**: change status to closed or frozen. Do not delete rows. You want an audit trail.
